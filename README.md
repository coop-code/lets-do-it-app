# Lets Do It App

Lets Do It App is the frontend part of the Lets Do It project, a task management app (a to-do list) implemented for studying purposes.
This app is developed using the **AngularJS** framework and the **Angular Material** for better UX.
Special Thanks to Pluralsight for providing amazing courses on AngularJS and [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa) for providing an excellent [style guide on AngularJS](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md).

## Lets Do It Project

This project is divided into two subprojects:

* The **frontend** subproject: the Lets Do It App, the one described in this document.
* The **backend** subproject: the [Lets Do It Api](https://github.com/coop-code/lets-do-it-api), which is a RESTFul Web Api implemented using NodeJS and MongoDB.

The main goal of the APP is to deal with user interactions.
The API, on the other way, deal with the data itself: processing and answering to all the requests made by the APP, such as task creation, getting tasks and much more.

The rest of this document will focus only on the APP. For more information about the API, please check its [repository](https://github.com/coop-code/lets-do-it-api)
