		<p>"Let's Do It" is a task management app (a to-do list) designed for studying purposes. This app was implemented using the following:</p>
	
		<md-list flex>
		
			<md-list-item class="md-2-line md-long-text">
				<div class="md-list-item-text">
					<h3><md-icon md-svg-icon="app/common/icon/angular-icon.svg" aria-label="angular"></md-icon>&nbsp<b>AngularJS framework</b></h3>
					<p>An open-source, JavaScript framework for front-end web applications development. It simplifies both development and testing.</p>
				</div>
			</md-list-item>
			
			<md-list-item class="md-2-line md-long-text">
				<div class="md-list-item-text">
					<h3><md-icon md-svg-icon="app/common/icon/angular-icon.svg" aria-label="angular"></md-icon>&nbsp<b>Angular Material</b></h3>
					<p>A UI Component framework for AngularJS developers, based on Google's Material Design Specification.</p>
				</div>
			</md-list-item>
			
		</md-list>
		
		<p>In order to work properly, this app interacts with an API to read, create, update e delete tasks. But don't worry, we already
			implemented one (a RESTFul Web API using <b>NodeJS</b> and <b>MongoDB</b>) and it is available for you!</p>
		<p>Well, I'm sure you came here to test the APP and see how it works. If you want to create a task, just click on the "add" button
			at the bottom right and a form will pop up.</p>
		<p>The Let's Do It App provides all the basic operations regarding tasks (read, creation, editing and deleting). Some other
			operations were added, such as prioritize and mark the task as finished or unfinished. The tasks are separated as follows:</p>
		
		<md-list flex>
		
			<md-list-item class="md-2-line md-long-text">
				<div class="md-list-item-text">
					<h3><md-icon>assignment</md-icon>&nbspTASKS </h3>
					<p>These are unfinished or pending tasks. They can be edited, prioritized, marked as done and deleted. </p>
				</div>
			</md-list-item>
			
			<md-list-item  class="md-2-line md-long-text">
				<div class="md-list-item-text">
					<h3><md-icon>assignment_turned_in</md-icon>&nbspFINISHED </h3>
					<p>These are finished or completed tasks. They can be viewed, deleted and reopened (marked as unfinished). </p>
				</div>
			</md-list-item>
			
		</md-list>
		
		<p>Finished tasks are pretty intuitive by themselves. On the other hand, unfinished tasks have some explicit information on them, priority and deadline to be more precise. They are showed as follows:</p>
		
		<md-list flex>
		
			<md-list-item class="md-2-line md-long-text">
				<div class="md-list-item-text">
					<h3>
						<md-chips class="homeExample">
							<md-chip readonly="true" md-removable="false">X days</md-chip>
						</md-chips>&nbspDEADLINE
					</h3>
					<p>
						These are named "chips" and they show the remaining days until a task reaches its deadline, if it exists. The colors give a visual hint about how close to its deadline a task is, ranging from green (far) to red (close).
					</p>
				</div>
			</md-list-item>
			
			<md-list-item class="md-2-line md-long-text">
				<div class="md-list-item-text">
					<h3><md-icon>star</md-icon>&nbspPRIORITY </h3>
					<p>The star symbol is used to indicate a task of critical priority. </p>
				</div>
			</md-list-item>
			
		</md-list >
		
		<p>Also, you will notice that the unfinished tasks are ordered using the two characteristics above, both "priority" and "deadline". We decided, arbitrarily, that "priority" would have a higher...well...a higher priority than "deadline". Haha.</p>
		<p>Feel free to use this APP the way you like and test whatever you want, after all, it was made for studying purposes. If you want to report any issue, please do so at our <a class="light-link" href="https://github.com/coop-code/lets-do-it-app">APP repository on GitHub</a>.</p>
